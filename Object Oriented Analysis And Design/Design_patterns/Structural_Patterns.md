## [Adapter Pattern](adapter.md)

## Introduction

The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces, making it possible for them to work together without modifying their existing code.

## Where to Use

The Adapter Design Pattern is useful in the following scenarios:

1. When you want to use an existing class, but its interface is not compatible with the one you need.
2. When you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with unrelated or unforeseen classes (i.e., classes that don't necessarily have compatible interfaces).
3. When you need to use several existing subclasses, but it's impractical to adapt their interface by subclassing every one. An object adapter can adapt the interface of its parent class.

## [Bridge Pattern](Bridge.md)

The Bridge Design Pattern is another structural design pattern that focuses on **decoupling an abstraction from its implementation so that they can vary independently**. This separation allows you to extend both the abstraction and the implementation without affecting each other, promoting flexibility and maintainability in your code.

**Core Components**

- **Abstraction:** Defines the general interface or functionality that clients will interact with. It can be an abstract class or interface.
- **ConcreteAbstraction:** Extends the abstraction and provides specific implementations for some aspects of the functionality.
- **Implementation:** Defines the core operations or algorithms that can vary independently. It can also be an abstract class or interface.
- **ConcreteImplementation:** Implements the implementation and provides specific functionality for a particular variant.

**When to Use the Bridge Pattern**

Consider using the bridge pattern when:

- You need to support different variations of both the abstraction and the implementation without creating a complex inheritance hierarchy.
- You want to change the implementation of an object without affecting the clients using it.
- You're designing a system that needs to be easily extensible with new implementations or abstractions.



## [Composite Pattern](Composite.md)

### Introduction

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. The pattern allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## [Decorator Pattern](decorator.md)


The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to individual objects dynamically without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. It's used to extend or modify the functionality of objects at runtime by wrapping them in an object of a decorator class.

### Where to Use

Use the Decorator Pattern in the following scenarios:

- When you need to add behavior or responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently.
- When subclassing to extend behavior is impractical or when too many subclasses would be needed.
- When you want to avoid a situation where the class explodes with multiple subclasses to handle all combinations of responsibilities.


## [Facade](facade.md)

The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, interfaces, or subsystems. It acts as a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier to use.

## [Proxy Pattern](proxy.md)

The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It allows you to create a class that represents the functionality of another class, acting as a wrapper or intermediary. This can be useful for adding additional logic or controlling access to the original object.

## [Flyweight Pattern](flyweight.md)

The Flyweight Pattern is a structural design pattern that aims to minimize memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with similar objects. It's particularly useful when dealing with a large number of objects that have significant overlap in their state and can be shared effectively.
