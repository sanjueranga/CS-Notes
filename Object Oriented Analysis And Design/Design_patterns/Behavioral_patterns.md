### [Observer Pattern](Observer.md)

#### Introduction

The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is useful for implementing distributed event handling systems.


## [Strategy Pattern](Strategy.md)

### Introduction

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. The Strategy Pattern lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. This pattern is useful when you want to choose an algorithm's behavior at runtime.

## [Command Pattern](command.md)

### Introduction

The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you parameterize methods with different requests, delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.

## [Chain of Responsibility Pattern](Chain_of_Responsibility.md)

The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until the request is handled. Each handler in the chain either handles the request or passes it to the next handler in the chain. This pattern decouples the sender of a request from its receivers, giving multiple objects a chance to handle the request.

## [Interpreter Pattern](Interpreter.md)


The Interpreter Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expressions. The pattern defines a representation for a grammar along with an interpreter that uses this representation to interpret sentences in the language.


## [Iterator Pattern](Iterator.md)


The Iterator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It decouples the traversal logic from the collection itself.


## [Mediator Pattern](Mediator.md)

### Introduction

The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern promotes loose coupling by preventing objects from referring to each other explicitly and lets you vary their interaction independently.

## [Memento Pattern](Memento.md)

### Introduction

The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state. The pattern is implemented with three objects: the originator, a caretaker, and a memento. The originator creates a memento containing a snapshot of its current state, the caretaker keeps the memento, and the originator uses the memento to restore its state

## [State Pattern](State.md)

### Introduction

The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The pattern encapsulates state-specific behavior into separate classes and delegates the responsibility for state transitions to these classes.
