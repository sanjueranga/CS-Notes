# Requirements Analysis:

This stage involves gathering and analyzing system requirements from stakeholders. Requirements analysis aims to understand the needs, constraints, and objectives of the system. It involves techniques such as interviews, surveys, and workshops to gather information. The output of this stage is a comprehensive understanding of the problem domain, including functional and non-functional requirements.

# Object Identification:

In this stage, the focus is on identifying relevant objects in the problem domain. Objects are real-world entities or concepts that have attributes and behaviors. Object identification involves analyzing the requirements and identifying nouns, verbs, and associations between them to identify potential objects. The identified objects serve as the building blocks for the system's design.

# Class Design:

Once the objects are identified, the next stage is to design classes to represent these objects in the system. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, defining their attributes (data) and behaviors (methods). Class design involves defining the structure and relationships between classes using techniques such as class diagrams, inheritance, associations, aggregations, and compositions.

# User Interface Design:

This stage focuses on designing the user interface (UI) of the system. User interface design involves creating user-friendly interfaces that enable users to interact with the system effectively. It includes designing layouts, navigation flows, and graphical elements to provide an intuitive and engaging user experience. Techniques such as wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing are used in UI design.

# Implementation:

Implementation is the stage where the system is actually built based on the design created in earlier stages. It involves writing code, integrating components, and testing the system to ensure that it meets the specified requirements. Implementation may involve programming languages, frameworks, and tools chosen based on the system's requirements and design.
