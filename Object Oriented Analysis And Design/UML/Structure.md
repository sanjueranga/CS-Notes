### To create a UML diagram adhering to the provided instructions, follow these guidelines:

1. Start by placing the class name at the top of the box.
2. Use `<<interface>>` on top of interface names.
3. Italicize the name of an abstract class.
4. Include attributes (fields) within the class box, following the format:
   - Visibility name : Type [count] = default_value
   - Use symbols for visibility:
     - `+` for public
     - `#` for protected
     - `-` for private
     - `~` for package (default)
     - `/` for derived
   - Underline static attributes
   - Derived attributes should be included but marked as not stored
5. Include operations/methods within the class box, following the format:
   - Visibility name(parameters) : return_type
   - Use symbols for visibility:
     - `+` for public
     - `#` for protected
     - `-` for private
     - `~` for package (default)
   - Underline static methods
   - Parameter types should be listed as (name: type)
   - Omit return_type on constructors and when return type is void


# Relationships Between Classes

## [ Generalization:](generalization.md)

- **Description:** Represents an inheritance relationship between classes.
- **Types:**
  - **Inheritance Between Classes:** Indicates that one class (subclass) inherits from another class (superclass), inheriting its properties and behaviors.
  - **Interface Implementation:** Denotes that a class implements the methods defined in an interface, providing a contract for its behavior.

## [Association:](association.md)

- **Description:** Signifies a usage relationship between classes.
- **Types:**
  - **Dependency:** Indicates that one class depends on another class, often for method invocation or parameter passing.
  - **Aggregation:** Represents a "has-a" relationship where one class contains objects of another class as part of its state. The contained objects have an independent lifecycle.
  - **Composition:** Denotes a stronger form of aggregation where one class is composed of other classes as its parts. The parts are integral to the whole and have a lifecycle dependent on the containing class.

Relationships between classes in UML diagrams provide insights into how classes interact and collaborate within a software system. Understanding these relationships is essential for designing robust and maintainable object-oriented systems.
