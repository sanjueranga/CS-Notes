# UML Usage Scenarios

## As a Sketch:

- **Communication:** Used to communicate aspects of the system quickly and informally.
- **Forward Design:** UML sketches are created before coding to outline system structure and behavior.
- **Backward Design:** UML sketches can also be done after coding as a form of documentation.

## As a Blueprint:

- **Complete Design:** Provides a detailed and comprehensive design to be implemented.
- **CASE Tools:** Often utilized with Computer-Aided Software Engineering tools for formalized design documentation.

## As a Programming Language:

- **Auto-Generation:** With the right tools, code can be auto-generated and executed from UML diagrams.
- **Efficiency Consideration:** This approach is advantageous only if auto-generation is faster than coding in a traditional programming language.

UML serves various purposes, ranging from informal sketching for communication and idea generation to formalized blueprints for system design and even as a basis for code generation and execution.
