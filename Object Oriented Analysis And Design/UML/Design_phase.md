Key aspects of the design phase include:

- **Identifying Classes:** Determining what classes will be needed to implement a system that meets the specified requirements.

- **Defining Fields and Methods:** Specifying the attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods) that each class will have. This includes deciding what data each class will hold and what operations it will perform.

- **Managing Class Interactions:** Designing how the classes will interact with each other. This involves defining the relationships, dependencies, and communication pathways between different classes in the system.

Design lays the foundation for the implementation phase by providing a detailed plan for how the system will be developed. It helps in understanding the overall architecture of the system and ensures that it will meet the desired objectives and requirements.
