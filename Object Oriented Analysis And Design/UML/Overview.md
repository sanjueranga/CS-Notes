## What is UML?
- UML, short for Unified Modeling Language, is a standardized modeling language consisting of an integrated set of diagrams. It is developed to help system and software developers for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems, as well as for business modeling and other non-software systems.
  
## Why should I bother? Do people really use UML?
- UML helps software developers visualize, construct, and document new software systems and blueprints.
- It is used to create static structure diagrams based on a variety of engineering practices that have proven to be successful in the creation of complex systems.
- The use of UML can vary. Some developers use it extensively, while others use it when they need to communicate an idea.
- It's also noted that UML has become complex and for 80% of all software only 20% of UML is needed.

## UML Class Diagrams
### What is a UML class diagram?
- A class diagram in UML is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.

### What kind of information goes into it?
- A UML class diagram includes the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.
- Each class in the diagram represents a group of objects with similar roles in the system, which consists of structural features (attributes) and behavioral features (operations).

### How do I create it?
- To create a UML class diagram, you start by identifying the classes, their attributes, operations, and the relationships among the classes.
- Each class is represented as a box divided into three sections: the top section contains the class name, the middle section contains the attributes, and the bottom section contains the operations.
- Various tools like Visual Paradigm, Lucidchart, and Microsoft Visio provide functionalities to create UML class diagrams.

### When should I create it?
- Creating class diagrams during the design phase facilitates the development process by clearly showing classes, their attributes, and their methods.
- They also show how the classes relate to each other. Seeing a conceptual build of a system before any code is written helps developers communicate with one another, and with other stakeholders.


# UML: Pictures of an OO System

UML (Unified Modeling Language) provides a standardized way to visually represent an Object-Oriented (OO) system. It serves as a common language for communicating and documenting system designs across different stakeholders.

## Why Use UML?

- **Abstraction:** Programming languages may not be abstract enough for OO design. UML provides a higher-level abstraction that focuses on system structure and behavior rather than implementation details.

- **Standardization:** UML is an open standard adopted by many companies and organizations. Its widespread usage ensures consistency and facilitates collaboration among developers and stakeholders.

## Legal UML

- **Descriptive Language:** UML has a rigid formal syntax similar to programming languages, ensuring precise and unambiguous communication of system designs.

- **Prescriptive Language:** UML is also shaped by usage and convention. While it provides standardized symbols and diagrams, teams may adapt and customize UML diagrams based on their specific needs and preferences.

- **Omission of Details:** It's acceptable to omit certain elements from UML diagrams if they aren't relevant to the team, supervisor, or instructor. This allows for a more streamlined and focused representation of the system design.

UML diagrams serve as visual blueprints that depict the structure, behavior, and interactions of objects within an OO system. They help in understanding, communicating, and documenting complex software designs in a clear and standardized manner.
