# Hierarchical Relationships in UML

- Hierarchies are typically drawn top-down, indicating the parent-child relationships between classes.
- Arrows point upward from child classes to their parent classes.
- Different line and arrow styles are used to indicate the type of parent class:
  - **Class:** Represented by a solid line with a black arrow.
  - **Abstract Class:** Depicted with a solid line and a white arrow.
  - **Interface:** Shown with a dashed line and a white arrow.
- Trivial or obvious generalization relationships, such as the Object class as a parent, are often omitted to reduce clutter in the diagram.

These conventions help in visually representing the hierarchical structure of classes in UML diagrams, making them easier to understand and interpret.
