# Introduction to SDLC

## Brief Overview

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a fundamental concept in software engineering, providing a structured approach to the development of software from inception to deployment. It serves as a roadmap for software projects, guiding the team through various phases to ensure the delivery of high-quality, reliable software products.

## Phases of SDLC

- **Planning**: In this phase, project objectives, scope, deliverables, and timelines are defined. It lays the foundation for the entire development process.

- **Analysis**: Requirements are gathered, analyzed, and documented in detail. This phase focuses on understanding the needs of stakeholders and translating them into functional specifications.

- **Design**: The architectural and technical design of the software system is created, outlining how the requirements will be implemented. This phase involves designing data structures, algorithms, user interfaces, and system components.

- **Implementation**: The actual coding and development of the software occur in this phase. Developers write code according to the design specifications, following coding standards and best practices.

- **Testing**: The software undergoes various testing activities to identify and rectify defects. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing to ensure that the software meets quality standards.

- **Deployment**: The software is deployed to the production environment or released to end-users. This phase involves installation, configuration, and user training, preparing the software for live use.

- **Maintenance**: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored, updated, and enhanced to address bugs, performance issues, and changing requirements.


# [Waterfall Model](waterfall.md)

The Waterfall model is a traditional approach to SDLC, characterized by its sequential nature where each phase flows downwards like a waterfall. It consists of the following phases:

- **Requirements**: Gathering and documenting user requirements.
- **Design**: Creating system and software designs based on the requirements.
- **Implementation**: Writing code and developing the software.
- **Testing**: Conducting testing activities to ensure quality.
- **Deployment**: Releasing the software to end-users.
- **Maintenance**: Providing ongoing support and updates.

Advantages of the Waterfall model include clear structure and well-defined requirements. However, it lacks flexibility and may struggle to accommodate changes during development.

# [Agile Methodology](agile.md)

Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to SDLC, focusing on collaboration, adaptability, and customer feedback. It emphasizes the following principles:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

Popular Agile frameworks include Scrum and Kanban, which promote iterative development cycles and frequent product increments.
