Check whether the software correctly implements functions.
Verify against SRS

### Validation

**Are we building the right product**

Check whether the specification captures the customer's requirements

1. SW Inspection
• Check whether the system represents the SRS, design diagrams,
and program code.
• This can be apply at all stages of the process.
• This does not require the system to be developed or deployed.

2. SW Testing
• The process of identifying correctness, completeness, security, and
quality of the developed system.
• The system needs to be developed, hence it can be executed
against all possible data to identify errors or problems if any.
