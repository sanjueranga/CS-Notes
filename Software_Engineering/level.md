# Levels Of Testing

## Unit Testing
• **Testing of an individual program or module**
• Identifies and eliminates syntax errors and logic errors
• Test data contains both correct and erroneous data
• Need to test all possible situations that could occur
• System analyst creates test data and test plan
• Test plan – detailed procedures that specify how and when the testing will be performed, who will participate and what
test will be used

## Integration Testing

**Testing two or more programs that depend on each other**

## System Testing

**Testing the entire system**

• Assure users, developers and managers that the program meets all specifications
• Users enter data, perform queries and produce reports to simulate actual operating conditions
• Processing options and outputs are verified by users and project development team


*Objectives*
1)Perform a final test of all programs
2)Verify that system will handle all valid and invalid inputs
properly
3)Ensure that IT staff has the documentation and instructions
needed to operate the system and backup capabilities are
adequate
4)Demonstrate that users can interact with system
successfully
5)Verify that all system components are integrated properly and actual processing situations are handled correctly
6)Confirm that IS can handle predicted volumes of data


## Acceptance Testing

User Acceptance Testing (UAT), also known as beta or end-user testing, is defined as testing the software by the user or client to
determine whether it can be accepted or not.

This is the final testing performed once the functional, system and regression testing are completed


- The main purpose of this testing is to validate the software against the business requirements.
- This validation is carried out by the end-users who are familiar with the business requirements.
