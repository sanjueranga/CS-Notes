### Requirements Engineering Process

**1. Overview of the Requirements Engineering Process**

- The **requirements engineering process** involves a series of steps that help in understanding, documenting, validating, and managing the requirements of a system. It ensures that the final product aligns with stakeholder needs and expectations.

**2. Steps in the Requirements Engineering Process**

- **Requirements Elicitation:**
    - The process of gathering requirements from stakeholders.
    - Involves understanding and capturing what users and stakeholders need from the system.
- **Requirements Analysis:**
    - Analyzing the gathered requirements to identify conflicts, ambiguities, and inconsistencies.
    - Helps refine and clarify requirements to ensure they are complete and accurate.
- **Requirements Validation:**
    - Ensures that the documented requirements accurately reflect the stakeholders' needs.
    - Involves reviewing, verifying, and validating requirements with stakeholders to avoid misunderstandings.
- **Requirements Management:**
    - The ongoing process of managing changes to the requirements as the project progresses.
    - Involves tracking, controlling, and maintaining the integrity of the requirements throughout the development lifecycle.

### Requirements Elicitation

**1. Stages of Requirements Elicitation**

- **Requirements Discovery:**
    - Interacting with stakeholders to discover and gather their requirements.
    - Identifies domain requirements, which are specific to the application domain.
- **Requirements Classification and Organization:**
    - Grouping related requirements and organizing them into coherent clusters.
    - Helps in structuring the requirements to make them easier to understand and manage.
- **Requirements Prioritization and Negotiation:**
    - Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and urgency.
    - Resolving conflicts between stakeholders when requirements are in opposition.
- **Requirements Specification:**
    - Documenting the requirements in a clear, detailed manner.
    - The output serves as input for the next phase of development, often in an iterative or spiral process.

**2. Problems of Requirements Elicitation**

- **Stakeholder Communication Issues:**
    
    - Difficulties in communicating with stakeholders, leading to misunderstandings or incomplete information.
    - Different stakeholders may have conflicting or unclear requirements.
- **Ambiguity in Requirements:**
    
    - Requirements may be vague, ambiguous, or open to multiple interpretations.
    - Lack of clarity can lead to confusion and misaligned expectations.
- **Incomplete Requirements:**
    
    - Some requirements may be overlooked or not fully captured during elicitation.
    - Missing requirements can lead to significant issues later in the development process.
- **Changing Requirements:**
    
    - Stakeholders may change their minds or discover new needs during the project, leading to scope creep.
    - Managing changes without impacting the project's timeline and budget can be challenging.
- **Domain Complexity:**
    
    - In complex domains, understanding and capturing all relevant requirements can be difficult.
    - Domain-specific language and concepts may create barriers to accurate elicitation.
- **Cultural and Organizational Barriers:**
    
    - Different cultural or organizational backgrounds may affect how requirements are expressed and understood.
    - Misalignment between organizational goals and stakeholder expectations can lead to conflicts.
