**1. Types of Requirements**

- **System Requirements:**
    - Define the overall functionality, behavior, and constraints of the system.
    - Provide a detailed specification that the system must fulfill.
- **User Requirements:**
    - Describe what the user expects from the system.
    - Focus on user needs and goals, often presented in a user-friendly format like use cases or user stories.
- **Agile Requirements:**
    - Are iterative and evolve throughout the development process.
    - Emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and continuous feedback.
    - Commonly captured in user stories and epics.

**2. Qualities of Good Requirements**

- **Clear and Unambiguous:** Requirements should be easily understood and interpreted in one way.
- **Complete:** All necessary information must be provided, covering all aspects of the system.
- **Consistent:** Requirements should not contradict each other.
- **Verifiable:** It should be possible to verify the requirement through testing or other means.
- **Feasible:** The requirement should be technically and financially achievable.
- **Relevant:** Requirements should directly relate to the goals and objectives of the system.
- **Traceable:** It should be possible to trace each requirement back to its source, whether it's a business objective or user need.

**3. Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Functional Requirements:**
    - Describe the specific behaviors or functions of the system.
    - Examples: User authentication, data processing, and report generation.
- **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    - Define system attributes such as performance, usability, reliability, and security.
    - These are often divided into three categories:
        - **Product Requirements:** Performance, reliability, usability, efficiency, etc.
        - **Organizational Requirements:** Policies, standards, operational environments, etc.
        - **External Requirements:** Regulatory compliance, legal obligations, interoperability with other systems, etc.

**4. Non-Functional Requirements Types**

- **Product Requirements:**
    - Focus on the qualities and attributes of the product itself.
    - Examples: Response time, throughput, accuracy, and scalability.
- **Organizational Requirements:**
    - Relate to the environment in which the product will operate.
    - Examples: Development standards, deployment environments, and company policies.
- **External Requirements:**
    - Consider factors outside the organization that might influence the product.
    - Examples: Regulatory compliance, legal constraints, and external interfacing systems.
