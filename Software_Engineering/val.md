### Requirements Validation

**1. Overview of Requirements Validation**

- **Requirements Validation** is the process of ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect the needs and expectations of the stakeholders. It helps identify errors, inconsistencies, and ambiguities early in the development process, reducing the risk of costly changes later.

**2. Things to Check During Requirements Validation**

- **Correctness:** Ensure that the requirements correctly represent the stakeholders' needs and that the specified system will achieve the intended goals.
- **Completeness:** Check that all necessary requirements are included and that there are no missing aspects that could affect the system's functionality.
- **Consistency:** Validate that there are no conflicting requirements and that the requirements are logically coherent.
- **Clarity and Unambiguity:** Ensure that the requirements are expressed clearly and unambiguously, with no room for misinterpretation.
- **Verifiability:** Confirm that each requirement can be tested or verified to ensure it has been implemented correctly.
- **Feasibility:** Assess whether the requirements are technically and financially feasible within the given constraints.
- **Traceability:** Verify that each requirement can be traced back to a source, such as a stakeholder need or business objective.

**3. Validation Techniques**

- **Requirements Reviews:**
    - A systematic examination of the requirements by stakeholders, developers, and other relevant parties.
    - Aims to identify issues such as errors, omissions, or ambiguities.
- **Prototyping:**
    - Creating a working model of the system or parts of the system to validate requirements by showing stakeholders how the system will work.
    - Helps uncover hidden requirements or potential usability issues.
- **Test Case Generation:**
    - Developing test cases based on the requirements to ensure that they are verifiable and that the system can be tested against them.
    - Helps validate that the requirements are clear, complete, and implementable.
- **Modeling and Simulation:**
    - Using models or simulations to validate complex requirements, particularly those involving dynamic interactions or performance constraints.
    - Provides a visual and interactive means to verify requirements.

**4. Requirement Reviews**

**Review Checks:**

- **Verifiability:** Can each requirement be verified through testing or other validation methods?
- **Incomprehensibility:** Are any requirements unclear, ambiguous, or difficult to understand?
- **Traceability:** Can each requirement be traced back to its origin, such as a stakeholder or business need?
- **Adaptability:** Are the requirements flexible enough to accommodate changes in the system or business environment?

**5. Requirements Change**

**1. Requirements Evolution**

- **Requirements Evolution** refers to the natural changes that occur in requirements over time as the project progresses, the business environment shifts, or stakeholders' needs evolve.
- **Reasons for Requirements Evolution:**
    - **Changing Business Needs:** Stakeholders may identify new needs or priorities as the project progresses.
    - **Technology Advancements:** Emerging technologies may introduce new possibilities or constraints.
    - **Regulatory Changes:** New laws or standards may necessitate changes in the systemâ€™s requirements.
    - **Feedback from Development:** As the system is built and tested, new insights may lead to refinements or adjustments.

**2. Requirements Change Management**

- **Change Request Submission:**
    - Stakeholders submit a formal request for a change in requirements, detailing the reason and the expected impact.
- **Impact Analysis:**
    - Assess the potential effects of the proposed change on the system, including costs, schedule, and other requirements.
- **Change Approval:**
    - A change control board or similar authority reviews the request and decides whether to approve, reject, or modify it.
- **Implementation and Tracking:**
    - Approved changes are implemented, and their effects are monitored and documented.
- **Version Control:**
    - Managing different versions of the requirements document to track changes over time and ensure consistency across the project.

### Summary

**Requirements Validation** is a crucial step in ensuring that the documented requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs. It involves various checks and techniques, including reviews and test case generation. **Requirements Change** is an inevitable part of the development process, driven by evolving business needs, technology advancements, and other factors. Effective management of these changes is essential to ensure that the project remains on track and that the final product meets the intended goals.
