# Software Application Testing

Software Testing is any activity aimed at evaluating an attribute or capability of a program or system and determining that it meets its required result.

##### Testing the System
• After coding, a programmer must test each program
• Then programs are tested in groups and finally the development team test the entire system

Steps
1)Compile the program and detect syntax errors
2)Desk check – review program code to spot logic errors
3)Code review – peer groups identify errors, apply quality standards and verify that program meets requirements of the design spec
4)Design walkthrough – review the interface with users of the new system
5)Initiate unit testing, integration testing and system testing
