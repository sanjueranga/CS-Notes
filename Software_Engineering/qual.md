### Software Quality Assurance


• Rigorous testing can detect errors during implementation
• It is less expensive to identify and correct errors earlier in the development process
• Objective 
	- to avoid problems or to identify problems as quickly as possible
• Poor quality is due to inaccurate requirements, design problems, coding errors, faultydocumentation and ineffective testing



• **Software Engineering Institute (SEI)** has introduced a set of software development standards known as
**Capability maturity Model (CMM)**
• Specifies an increasing series of levels of a software development organization to improve quality, reduce development time and cut costs.
• The higher the level, the better the software development process, hence reaching each level is an expensive and time-consuming process

• SEI has established a new model called Capability
**Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)**
• CMM vs CMMI
• It tracks an organization’s processes using 5 maturity
levels

1. Initial
2. Repeatable
3. Defined
4. Managed
5. Optimizing



• Initial – processes are disorganized. Success is likely to depend on individual efforts and is not considered to be repeatable. Processes would not be sufficiently defined and documented to allow them to be replicate

• Repeatable – basic project management techniques are established, and success could be repeated

• Defined – organization has developed its own standard software process through attention to documentation, standardization and integration

• Managed – organization monitors and controls its own processes through data collection and analysis

• Optimizing – processes are constantly being improved through monitoring feedback from current processes and introducing innovative processes




### Immature Software Organizations
• Processes are ad-hoc and occasionally chaotic
• Processes improvised by practitioners.
• Testing and reviews usually curtailed under stress.
• Quality is unpredictable.
• Costs and schedules are usually exceeded.
• Reactionary management is usually firefighting.
• Success rides on individual talent and heroic effort.
• Technology benefits are lost in the noise.


### Mature Software Organizations

• Processes are defined and documented.
• Management plans, monitors, and communicates.
• Roles and responsibilities are clear.
• Product and process are measured.
• Quality, costs, and schedules are predictable
• Management committed to continuous
improvement.
• Technology used effectively within defined process.

verification and validation


Testing Approval
• After testing is complete, results are presented to
the management
• Test results need to be described when presenting
results
• If testing does not produce any technical,
economical or operational problem, then
management will determine a schedule for system
installation
